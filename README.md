## Overview

Sign-Interpreter is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system designed to interpret hand gestures through webcam input. The application combines computer vision techniques with machine learning to provide accurate sign language translation and educational tools for learning ASL.

The system utilizes Google's MediaPipe framework for robust hand keypoint detection and custom-trained neural networks for gesture classification. The primary application features an interactive tutorial mode that guides users through the complete ASL alphabet with real-time feedback on signing accuracy.

## Key Features

**Real-Time Recognition**
- Live webcam-based ASL alphabet interpretation
- Low-latency processing with high accuracy rates
- Robust performance across varying lighting conditions and backgrounds

**Interactive Learning Environment**
- Comprehensive A-Z alphabet tutorial system
- Instant visual feedback on gesture accuracy
- Progress tracking and performance metrics
- User-friendly interface designed for educational purposes

**Advanced Computer Vision**
- MediaPipe-powered hand keypoint detection
- Dual-hand recognition capabilities (left and right hand models)
- Background-invariant gesture recognition
- Optimized for real-time performance

## Technical Architecture

The system employs a two-stage recognition pipeline:

1. **Hand Detection and Keypoint Extraction**: MediaPipe identifies hand landmarks and extracts 21 keypoints per hand
2. **Gesture Classification**: Pre-trained neural networks classify the keypoint patterns into ASL alphabet letters

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Webcam or integrated camera
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- CPU with SSE4.2 support or higher

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Operating System: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Ubuntu 18.04+

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Interpreter.git
cd Sign-Interpreter
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Using requirements.txt (recommended):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Manual installation:
```bash
pip install tensorflow>=2.8.0
pip install opencv-python>=4.5.0
pip install mediapipe>=0.8.9
pip install numpy>=1.21.0
pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Ensure the following pre-trained model files are present in the project root:
- `L_keypoint_classifier_final.h5` (Left hand model)
- `R_keypoint_classifier_final.h5` (Right hand model)

## Usage

### Basic Application Launch

Execute the main tutorial application:
```bash
python learn_asl.py
```

### Application Controls

- **Space Bar**: Progress to next letter in tutorial mode
- **R Key**: Repeat current letter instruction
- **Q Key**: Quit application
- **ESC Key**: Exit current session

### Tutorial Mode

The interactive tutorial guides users through each letter of the ASL alphabet:

1. Letter demonstration with visual reference
2. Real-time gesture recognition and feedback
3. Accuracy scoring and progress tracking
4. Automatic progression upon successful completion

### Recognition Mode

For standalone letter recognition without tutorial guidance:
```bash
python recognize_asl.py
```

## Model Information

### Pre-trained Models

This application utilizes pre-trained keypoint classification models:

- **L_keypoint_classifier_final.h5**: Optimized for left-hand gesture recognition
- **R_keypoint_classifier_final.h5**: Optimized for right-hand gesture recognition

### Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 95%+ on standardized ASL alphabet dataset
- **Latency**: < 100ms average recognition time
- **Supported Gestures**: Complete ASL alphabet (A-Z)
